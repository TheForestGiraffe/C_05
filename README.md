# 42 Piscine — C_05: Memory and Manipulation

This repository contains my solutions for the **C_05 module** of the 42 Piscine curriculum.  
It focuses on functions, memory access, pointer usage, and fundamental manipulation of data in C.

---

## Topics Covered

- Pointers and pointer arithmetic  
- Manipulating arrays and strings  
- Memory access and modification  
- Writing functions that operate on data via pointers  

These exercises build the foundation for understanding how data is accessed and modified in C.

## Repository Structure

The source files are located at the root for easier browsing:

```
C_05/
├── ft_strlen.c
├── ft_swap.c
├── ft_div_mod.c
├── ft_... (other exercises)
├── C_05.pdf
└── README.md
```

Each `.c` file corresponds to an individual exercise.

### Structural Transparency Note

For readability and transparency, the exercise files in this repository
are stored at the root level.

During the original 42 Piscine submission, all files were organized
according to the required structure (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.).

They were later flattened for easier browsing and code review.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this module, I strengthened my abilities in:

✔ Working with pointers and memory locations  
✔ Understanding how functions manipulate data  
✔ Writing modular and reusable C code  
✔ Manual debugging and validation of behavior

## Part of My 42 Learning Path

This module is part of the foundational Piscine series that prepared me for
larger system-level projects such as:

- push_swap  
- minishell  
- fdf  
- minitalk  

It represents a key step in developing confidence with core C concepts.

## Notes

- Developed and tested on Linux  
- Compiled using `gcc`  
- Written according to 42 coding standards  
- Manually tested with multiple input cases
